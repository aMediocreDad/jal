# Journal Anchor Links

Since Foundry VTT V10, journal entry anchor links are finally supported in the core software. However, weirdly enough it doesn't support anchor links in scene notes. This module fixes that.

## How-To

Implementing this library in your module/system is easy:

1. Add it as a dependency in your manifest file _(`module.json` or `system.json`)_.
    - > Alternatively you can download the files and use the `lib.js` in your module.
2. Drag a heading from the Journal sidebar onto the map. Magic.
